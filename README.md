 # Tic-Tac-Toe
 

## Introduction 

Tic-Tac-Toe is a web based version of the classic paper and pencil game of the same name. 

## Prerequisites

Tic-Tac-Toe best played using Google's Chrome browser.

## Installation

To install Tic-Tac-Toe, download all repository files to your computer. Be sure to save them in the same directory (aka folder).

## How To Play

Tic-Tac-Toe operates the same as the paper and pencil version. In this case the first player (Red) chooses a square by clicking the mouse. The square will fill with Red. The next player (Blue) follows suit and the players alternate until there is a winner or all squares have been chosen.

The game can be reset with the Reset button at the bottom left of the game grid.
